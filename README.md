# PlugHome-server
Open, local-first EV charging management for home users.

## Backend
- Rust + Tokio + Axum web stack; entrypoint lives in api/src/main.rs and binds to ADDR:PORT from .env.
- Exposes a health check at `/` and a WebSocket upgrader at `/:station_id` for charger sessions.

## OCPP 1.6J WebSockets
- Built around rust-ocpp for parsing/serializing OCPP 1.6 JSON frames.
- Channel-specific state and message helpers live in the occp_ws crate (handlers, routes, state, types modules).
- The WebSocket flow and message handling are based on [FlipSoftware/moovolt-mvp](https://github.com/FlipSoftware/moovolt-mvp)

## Run locally
1) Create a .env file with ADDR (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and PORT (e.g., 3000).
  ```bash
  ADDR=0.0.0.0
  PORT=3000
  ```
2) Start the backend with: `cargo run api`
3) Connect an OCPP 1.6J client to ws://ADDR:PORT/{station_id}

## ✅ Planned Features & Capabilities

This project aims to provide a **self-hosted EV charger management server** that works reliably in home environments while remaining standards-compliant.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals (In Plain Terms)

* Run your **own charger server at home**
* Keep **full control of your charging data**
* Avoid cloud lock-in
* Work with real-world chargers reliably
* Stay simple first, powerful later

---
